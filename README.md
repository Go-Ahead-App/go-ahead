### About the Project

_Go-Ahead_ is a simple note-taking app that allows you to create, edit, and delete notes. It is built with _React_ and uses a _Rails API_ backend. It was created as a project for personal use and to practice building a React app with a Rails API backend. It is not intended for production use.
The main goal of this project is to take a real-life domain and latest version of tools and build a simple app figuring out new things along the way. :D

Tech stack of the project includes: _React 18_, _Rails 7_, _PostgreSQL_, and _Tailwind CSS_.
